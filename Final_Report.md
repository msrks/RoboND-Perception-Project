## Pick and Place Setup

### 1. For all three tabletop setups (test*.world), perform object recognition, then read in respective pick list (pick_list_*.yaml). Next construct the messages that would comprise a valid PickPlace request output them to .yaml format.

output is here.

>identify 100% of objects in test1.world, 80% (4/5) in test2.world and 75% (6/8) in test3.world.
